# Filling the Emptiness of Life v2

## intro 
In many ways I have it made, an interesting and well-paying job, a beautiful wife and healthy kids, a nice house and a piece of land. More than most it would seem. And yet something's not right, something's missing or incomplete. I don't mean for this to be a complaint, or to ask for pity. It's merely an observation I've had with my life, and maybe you, whether your life looks like mine, or outwardly it appears worse or better (by whatever metric you use), maybe you feel the same way. Just living, even when you are engaged, even when you have what you think it is you want, it isn't enough. That what you have doesn't mean anything on its own. It's just dust in the wind. That life is empty.

I noticed this problem after I had my first child, though I think it was there before, lying dormant, waiting to be discovered. Without kids, you have the time to be busy, to cover up whatever this longing is with running around and filling your time with activities, your home with things. But with children, there's so much less time, especially long blocks of time, that aren't already given over to sleep or work. You can't fill them the same way you used to, you begin to notice that time is finite, that life is finite, that it won't always be there to fill it as you wish. Mortality, death, becomes real. 

Death and the finite life, they are the same thing. We can't get our past back, what's done is done, it belongs not to us, but to Death. And what is it that we have to look forward to at the end? Death as well. We are shut in on both sides by the inevitable end. All we have is what is right here, this moment, now. But what is it that we should do with it? Especially in a life that gives us so many options, too many options. How can we choose? Between the various things we have to do, and also the things we'd like to do to escape or find pleasure in this life. Even if we choose, how can we know we've chosen well?

Reflecting back to before I became aware of the finitude of life [^1], I feel as though much of my time was wasted. I dabbled in many things, scratched the surface, but did nothing that endured, nothing that lasted. There was no true growth, nothing I can look back on and see the progression to a deeper knowledge, experience, or relationship. There was nothing left behind, whether tying me to myself or to others. It was all empty. Without the focus the awareness of a finite life brings, how can I know which things matter?

Do I care only because of my awareness of my end? If I dropped that awareness would I be free to not want the things I do to matter? But I can’t just drop it. There’s no putting a blindfold back over an aware mind. Nor can I bring myself to apathy. Distraction only works until I’m not distracted and realize I’ve wasted even more time. Even before I fully awoke to the limits of my life, I did feel an inkling that my efforts and time were spent in vain, and the awareness that I now have would have come with time anyway. No, I can't go back. My finitude is here, I need to sort it out.

It would appear that what I want is a driving reason or purpose for my action, a conviction that the things I'm doing matter and have impact, and that the things I'm doing impose a pull that makes me want to do them and fill me with passion

## purpose

I've tried thinking of a purpose to drive my action, identifying and trying to embody a vision for my life. But all the cliched things that seem like good purposes, family, children, helping others, making shit tons of money, they aren't enough, at least not for me. I've tried to use them, but there's still no underlying why. For what reason am I leading my family into the future? If I'm helping others, for what reason do I want their lives to improve? If I have all the money in the world, what would I even spend it on? It's all empty. 

And why do things need a purpose? What does that even mean? Am I stuck in some Silicon Valley spiral of productivity and production. Why can't I just exist and take in and enjoy. Because that still doesn't tell me why I am doing the things I'm doing. I can't accept that there's no purpose, no reason for me to act. I can't accept it, I won't. There must be something more. Some reason behind my being. And yet, there's no reason that seems to have an impact on me.

## to matter/impact
Could it be impacting others then? Just getting out and doing it? 

Helping others and relieving suffering then. But how to help? What to focus on? What suffering to eliminate (that doesn't just leave more suffering in its wake)? How can I know that what I'm doing is actually making a difference? There are so many different options in this life today, in the face of those options, how can you know that the option you are choosing is the most impactful. If it doesn't matter, that every bit truly does help, then impact itself doesn't matter. But we want to matter, not matter a little bit, but matter to the fullest of our being. We want to live a full, impactful life, not a partial one.

Does this mean we fallback on a Utilitarian ethic, provide the most good for the greatest number? Or do we focus on where our skills are put to the best use. Must the effort be for charity, or can we get rich relieving suffering? Today, I provide a minor good (helping to reduce the time and effort spent making relatively meaningless decisions) for an almost unfathomably large number of people, making the best use of my skills, and getting paid well to do it. And I believe that the good I'm providing, that reduction of decision effort, is valuable, that there can be suffering, fatigue, overwhelm in the face of having to make decisions, especially when we have to make so many. People I talk to have all experienced this overwhelming sense of decision fatigue, so I know my efforts aren't entirely pointless. And yet, I still can't help but think something is missing. Could I be doing something even more impactful, or do I want something more than to be doing something that matters?

## passion
If not purpose and impact, can I find hope in passion. I want to want to be doing what it is that I’m doing in life. I want to wake up every morning filled with the fire to get out and do whatever it is that I'm doing. 

But isn't passion fleeting? Sure, something might get me up in the morning today, but for how long can it be relied on? Not my entire life, that's for sure. If I anchor my life on passion, I'm forever chasing the next thing that can fulfill it. When it passes away, and it always does, I'm left with the same emptiness. Is that all that an be looked forward to in life? 

Passion also requires time, it requires that you pour your whole soul into it. I've done that before, but back when I had the time that passion required. Now, with the limited amount of spare time in my day, anything I might become passionate about doesn't have the time to put down roots. 

## the immortal moment
What is this longing that we’ve been discussing, it's nothing more than a desire for this moment to exist beyond this moment. For this moment to matter after it's gone, for me to want to bring "this moment" (i.e. the next moment) into existence, for me to decide what the moment is going to be, for this moment to endure beyond the fleeting pinprick of its existence. 

The solution to this, I think, as simple as it sounds, is presence, awareness, being. To experience the moment as it is, however it is. If I experience the moment instead of trying to run from it, if I experience it as it is instead of wishing it was how I want it to be or focusing on the next one, if I put my whole being into this moment—that is what makes a moment more than it is, what fills it with being, instead of leaving it empty. Experiencing the moment gives it purpose, experiencing the moment makes it impactful, experiencing the moment fills one with passion for it.

There is nothing more difficult, I've found, than trying to truly experiencing a moment. It’s true that it can come naturally at times, and when it does, it's the easiest thing in the world. But to experience every moment, I must experience the difficult ones too, and the boring ones, and the ones that are keeping me from doing what I really want, even when I'm interrupted. I must shut out all else except what is right here, right now in front of me. But shutting it out, how to do that? That’s the challenge, that’s what makes this so difficult, but that’s what must be overcome. 

I notice a problem immediately with this approach. It's all well and good to be present for each moment, but given the option of multiple possible moments, how can I choose between them? When the choice itself is the moment, when the moment is choosing, how can I live that moment? Is there any guidance I can rely on?

There was something I mentioned earlier, that when I look back upon my time before I was aware of my finite life, there was no real continuity between the things that I did. Nothing that endured from the before to the after. No thread of a story that bound together my life. Through all the moments of my life, I am continually creating that story of who I am. But if those moments are disjoint there is no story. If I start a thread, but then let it die without weaving it back in, it is wasted--it dies and I die. When faced with a moment that is a decision, my guidance should be what best binds the story together, how can I best join the story of my past with whatever idea I have of the story of my future. 

There's still more though. It's not enough to just weave it back into myself, I must also, I think, thread this moment, my moment, into the moments of others, to connect this moment right now, not only with my own past future, but with the past and future of the rest of humanity as well. 

## conclusion
What is this that I've discovered here? It's not the philosophy I've been practicing, not Stoicism. Nor is it American Catholicism, the religion I grew up with and let wither. Both of those, in popular practice, tend to focus not on filling this emptiness but on ethics and morality, with Stoicism providing a more personal code and religion more of an interpersonal one. Their concern for this moment is nothing beyond how I should behave ethically or morally in it, ignoring entirely the longing to make the moment more than it is. Not that they can't, and maybe they did in the past and could today if the popular practice is stripped away from them. But this longing is something our society and our culture today isn't equipped to handle. It papers over it with choice, purpose, passion, ethics, and morality, but when a person longs for their moments to be something, it gives us nothing, not even a hint that this is what it is we're looking for. It all leaves us empty.

Where does that leave me, and us? Having realized that all our choices, purposes, impacts, passions, ethics and morals isn't enough to fill the emptiness of life; that for me, this longing, this tragic emptiness of life, is at bottom a desire for a given moment to be more than it really is, to endure and last forever, knowing that it, like me must pass away. And that desire can be met by somehow, in someway, being fully present in each moment, giving up the thought of past moments, future moments, and alternate present ones, just accepting the one that's here, and then tying that moment back into the thread of my life from my past to my future and tying it into the thread of those around me.

But how I can do that, can I even do that? That I don't know. But I need to find out.
